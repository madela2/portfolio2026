        <h1>Pawpartner - Dog Activity Tracker (Web of Things project)</h1>
        <p>Pawpartner is a Web of Things prototype designed to improve dogs' wellbeing and strengthen the dog-owner
            relationship. The system uses a wearable Micro:Bit sensor to track activity and presents the data in a
            web-based interface with actionable insights for new dog owners.</p>

        <!--Project overview-->
        <h2>Project overview</h2>
        <p>Pawpartner is an activity-tracking system for dogs that combines hardware sensors and a web interface. A
            wearable MicroBit measures data, which is transmitted via Web Bluetooth to a web application. The data is
            stored in a database and visualozed to help owners understand whether their dog is getting enough daily
            activity. The project focuses on making activity data easy to understand and actionable, especially for new
            dog owners who may struggle to know how much exercise their dog needs.</p>
        <!--Problem and goal-->
        <!--My role and contributions-->
        <h2>My role and contributions</h2>
        <p>Frontend developer, with main responsibility for the monthly activity overview.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementing the monthly activity overview</li>
            <li>Fetching and rendering activity data from backend APIs</li>
            <li>Collaborating cloesly with backend and hardware contributors to integrate data flow</li>
            <li>Participating in UI and usability decisions</li>
        </ul>
        <!--How it works-->
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>A Micro:Bit with a built-in accelerometer tracks the dog's movement.</li>
            <li>Activity data is sent to a web application via Web Bluetooth (BLE).</li>
            <li>The web application sends the data to a backend using REST APIs.</li>
            <li>Activity data is stored in a MongoDB database.</li>
            <li>The web interface requests stored data through APIs and displays activity summaries.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
        <!--Teck stack-->
        <h2>Technology stack</h2>
        <p>Hardware</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Micro:Bit with built in accelerometer, Bluetooth and a battery bow with AAA-batteries</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Frontend</p>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Backend</p>
        <ul>
            <li>REST APIs</li>
            <li>MongoDB database</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why these choices?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Micro:Bit provided all required sensors and Bluetooth out of the box</li>
            <li>Accelerometers are commonly used in fitness trackers and step counters</li>
            <li>JavaScript was sufficient due to the project's limited scope and kept complexity manageable</li>
            <li>MongoDB suited the time-based activity data well</li>
        </ul>
        <!--Key features-->
        <h2>Key features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Wearable activity tracker for dogs</li>
            <li>Adjustable sensitivity based on dog weight</li>
            <li>Monthly activity overview</li>
            <li>Activity history stored in a database</li>
            <li>Personalized activity suggestions based on remaining daily activity needs</li>
            <li>Relationship status calculated from the daily activity</li>
        </ul>
        <!--Challenges and solutions-->
        <h2>Challenges and solutions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bluetooth connectivity</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Bluetooth connections are unstable and limited in range. To handle disconnections, the Micro:Bit
                    stores
                    activity data locally when offline and syncs it once the connection is restored.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Measuring activity accurately</li>
            <ul>
                <li>We implemented movement and activity thresholds that adapt based on the dog's weight.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Data flow</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Data is exchanged using UART over Web Bluetooth, parsed in the browser, and forwarded to the backend via REST APIs.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
